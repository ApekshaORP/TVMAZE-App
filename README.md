## Git clone

The git clone command copies your repository from GitHub to your local computer.
git clone url(git url)

## .gitignore
Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
example: nodemodules

## git init
This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.

## git add
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.

## git commit
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository.
Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.

git commit -m "Commit message in quotes"

## git pull
To get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local computer.

git pull <branch_name> <remote_URL/remote_name>

## git push
Sends local commits to the remote repository

git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>
